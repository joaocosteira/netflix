# Netflix Clone Project
This repository is part of a [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLMo0W7mTVo&list=PLf16UKl7nR5DaxECWIwHr82oXtQWgI4Ri&index=1) where a simple Netflix clone is built. This project is purely for educational purposes. **Not used as a mechanism to scam nor to impersonate the real Netflix.**

## Tecnologies Used:
- React
- [themoviedb.org](https://www.themoviedb.org)
- JavaScript
- Firebase (authentication and store)
- Pure css for styling

## Webiste
The final result can be accessed [here](https://netflix-bc549.web.app/).   
### Disclaimers:
- You most likely **will receive a danger warning** because the automated generated link contains the word **Netflix**. The website itself is not dangerous, as previously mentioned simply renders moviedb data.
- You may find dead images since the moviedb rate limits API accesses.
